\title{Utility that collects data from the HTTP reply into lines and
  calls user-provided function.

\description{
  When one provides an R function to process the body of
  the R rep
}
\usage{
chunkToLineReader(f, verbose = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{f}{a function that is to be called each time
    the \code{read} function is invoked and there are complete
    lines in that input.}
  \item{verbose}{a logical value. If \code{TRUE},
    information is displayed when there is any text
    that does not form a complete line and is held
    for processing in the next chunk.
  }
}
\details{
  This constructs a closure and then processes each chunk as
  they are passed to the read function.
  It strips away any text that does not form a complete line
  at the end of the chunk and holds this to be added to the next chunk
  being processed.
}
\value{
  A list with two components
  \item{read}{the function that will do the actual reading from the
    HTTP response stream and call the function \code{f} on each
    step (assuming the chunk has a line marker.}
  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
